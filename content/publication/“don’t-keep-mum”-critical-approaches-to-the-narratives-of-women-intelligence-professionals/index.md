abstract: Drawing upon a rise of women’s publicly shared narratives in the UK
  and US in the previous two decades, this article aims to challenge traditional
  perceptions of intelligence employment, finding that gender is an influential
  factor in career experiences and trajectories. We can gain unique insights
  into organizational practices and cultures by analyzing the ways in which
  women speak about their careers. Narratives are valuable but underutilized
  sources in intelligence studies. In incorporating critical approaches to
  women’s narratives, the intention is to move beyond the ‘finding’ of women in
  intelligence history to reveal a more nuanced understanding of intelligence
  work.
